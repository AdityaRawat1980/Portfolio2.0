  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Aditya Rawat</strong>, a passionate and self-driven software developer currently pursuing my
    Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA) at Poornima University. I specialize in building modern web applications using the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and have a strong foundation in <strong>Java</strong>, Python, and SQL.
  </p><br/>
  <p> 
    Over the past few years, I’ve worked on several real-world projects including an <strong>Inventory Management System</strong>, <strong>E-commerce platform (NIVRO)</strong>, and a <strong>Recipe Website</strong>. These projects reflect my problem-solving mindset and my passion for creating practical, user-focused solutions. 
  </p><br/>
  <p>
    I enjoy learning new technologies and constantly improving my skills. I’ve also explored areas like <strong>AI Data Annotation</strong> during my internship and contributed to open-source platforms. My goal is to build efficient, scalable applications that make a real impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring tech trends, participating in coding challenges, or reading about
    innovative startups.
